# Python CI/CD Example with Docker, AWS, and Airflow
This repository demonstrates an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline for a Python application using GitHub Actions, Docker, AWS ECR/ECS, and Apache Airflow. The pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying a Python application to a containerized environment.
Features
	•	Python Application: A simple Python program with unit tests.
	•	GitHub Actions CI: Automates testing and builds on code pushes or pull requests.
	•	Docker Integration: Packages the application into a Docker container.
	•	AWS ECR/ECS Deployment: Deploys the Docker image to AWS Elastic Container Service.
	•	Airflow Orchestration: Manages deployment tasks and automations.

**Getting Started**

Prerequisites
	1.	GitHub Account: Sign up here if you don’t have one.
	2.	AWS Account: Sign up here for ECR and ECS services.
	3.	Docker Installed: Install Docker.
	4.	Apache Airflow Installed: Install Airflow.

AWS Setup
	•	Create an ECR Repository for storing Docker images.
	•	Create an ECS Cluster and a corresponding Task Definition and Service.

** Pipeline Overview**

1. CI/CD Workflow

This project uses GitHub Actions to:
	•	Run automated tests (pytest).
	•	Build and push Docker images to AWS ECR.
	•	Trigger deployment tasks using Airflow.

2. Deployment Workflow
	•	Apache Airflow orchestrates the deployment process:
	•	Logs in to AWS ECR.
	•	Builds and pushes Docker images.
	•	Updates AWS ECS services to use the latest image.

**Steps to Run Locally**
Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/python-ci-cd-example.git
cd python-ci-cd-example
Run the Application: python main.py
Run tests pytest
docker build -t python-ci-cd-example .
docker run python-ci-cd-example

**How the Pipeline Works**

**GitHub Actions Workflow**
	1.	Build and Test:
	•	Automatically triggered on every push or pull request.
	•	Runs pytest to validate the application.
	2.	Docker Build and Push:
	•	Builds the Docker image.
	•	Pushes the image to AWS ECR.
	3.	Trigger Airflow Deployment:
	•	Airflow automates the deployment to AWS ECS.

**Airflow DAG Workflow**
	1.	Log in to AWS ECR.
	2.	Build and push Docker images.
	3.	Deploy to AWS ECS by updating the service with the latest image.

**Technologies Used**
	•	Python: For the application and testing.
	•	Docker: To package and run the application as a container.
	•	GitHub Actions: For CI/CD pipeline automation.
	•	AWS ECR/ECS: For container storage and deployment.
	•	Apache Airflow: For task orchestration and deployment automation.

**Future Enhancements**
	•	Add post-deployment validation and monitoring.
	•	Include Slack or email notifications for deployment status.
	•	Implement more complex workflows with Airflow.
